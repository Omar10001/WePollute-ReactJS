#    WePollute
Short for Weather/Pollution 
It's a mini-project that I made using ReactJS and OpenWeather API 

## Usage
1-Simply write your country name
2-Choose from the dropdown menu
3-Volia! now you have everything you need about you weather and air quality of your country

## Notice
If you're having some issues with performance it's not because of the bad code it's because I'm using a free plan for the API which limits API calls
